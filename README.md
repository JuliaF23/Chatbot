## ChatBot
The ultimate goal of the solution is to focus on online bike inspections without the need for staff intervention, emphasizing the reduction of fraud within the system.

This chatbot is designed to assist and answer customers' questions. When accessing the chat, the customer is greeted by the bot and then types in their request. The bot is prepared to answer any questions related to bike insurance.

## Example Scenario
Location-related questions: A person accesses the chatbot and asks, “Does the bike insurance have any location restrictions?” and receives the response, “We offer plans across the entire national territory.”
If the question is more specific, such as “I live in Salvador, does the insurance cover that?”, the chatbot replies, “We offer plans across the entire national territory, including $city.”
In this case, the chat uses a context variable, storing the user’s input and displaying it back. This helps answer another question and speeds up the process.
